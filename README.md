## What Is "Fizzbuzz"?
There are many different variations of the fizzbuzz challenge. For this one in particular we are saying that "fizzbuzz" is the name of the function which takes a string of arbitrary size as it's input and returns the same string but with a few modifications- every third word is replaced with "fizz", every fifth word is replaced with "buzz", and every fifteenth word if replaced with "fizzbuzz".
