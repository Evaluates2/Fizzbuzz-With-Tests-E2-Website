# Evaluates2 NodeJS Fizzbuzz!
Examples of writing node.js functions with units tests! yay!!

## Functional Vs Class-Based
We could have architected our fizzbuzz code either using a JavaScript class or not using classes at all. I couldn't decide which one to do... so I just did both. ðŸ˜‰

## Scaffolding
This pretty raw vanilla javascript. I created this project with `npm init` and really only installed mocha, chai, and other testing packages.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (for running tests):
```
npm i
```

2. Run tests
```
npm test
```

or run tests in watch mode (nice for devloping TDD style):
```
npm run test-watch
```
